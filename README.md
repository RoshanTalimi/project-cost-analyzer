# Cost Analyzer App

The Cost Analyzer App is a personal finance tool designed to help users track and analyze their spending by aggregating transaction data from various financial accounts. The project was inspired by the upcoming change from American Express, effective March 17, 2025, which will restrict third-party providers (TPPs) from accessing account information. This app aims to fill that gap by providing a user-controlled solution for managing and visualizing financial data.

Starting with American Express, the app will initially process transaction data—potentially via uploaded invoice PDFs or direct transaction imports—and provide insights into spending patterns. Future iterations will expand to include other credit cards and bank accounts.

## Motivation
As of March 17, 2025, American Express will no longer allow third-party providers to access account details (see [updated terms](https://www.americanexpress.com/content/dam/amex/se/documents/medlemsvillkor/kreditkort.pdf)). This change limits the ability to use existing tools for centralized financial tracking. The Cost Analyzer App empowers users to take control of their data and build a custom solution tailored to their needs.

## Features (Planned)
- **Initial Focus**: Parse and analyze American Express transactions (e.g., from uploaded invoice PDFs).
- **Data Input**: Support for manual uploads or potential transaction scraping (TBD).
- **Cost Breakdown**: Visualize spending by category, date, or custom filters.
- **Extensibility**: Add support for additional cards and banks in future updates.
- **Privacy First**: Local data processing to keep your financial information secure.

## Getting Started
*(To be updated as development progresses)*  
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/cost-analyzer-app.git`
2. Install dependencies (TBD).
3. Upload your American Express invoice PDF or transaction data.
4. Run the app to analyze your costs.

## Roadmap
- **Phase 1**: Build a basic parser for American Express invoice PDFs.
- **Phase 2**: Categorize the transactions
- **Phase 3**: Add data visualization (charts, summaries)
- **Phase 4**: Expand to other financial institutions (credit cards, banks)
- **Phase 5**: Allow adjustments to the transactions (e.g. if you have received compensations for some costs)
- **Phase 6**: Enhance with budgeting tools and export options.
